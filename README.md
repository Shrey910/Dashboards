# Netflix-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
🔍 Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows spanning from 1925 to 2021. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to uncover key trends, such as the distribution of content by type, genre popularity, and regional availability.

📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of 8,808 entries and includes attributes like title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and genre. The goal was to clean, process, and visualize this data to extract meaningful insights.

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visualizations:

    --> Total Directors: Displays the number of unique directors featured in the dataset.
    --> Total Shows & Movies: Highlights the total count of shows and movies available on Netflix.
